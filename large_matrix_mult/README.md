Matrix multiplication is one of the operators that has wide applications in image processing, scientific computing, simulation, robotics, and so on. 
Therefore, providing a fast speed implementation using CPU, GPU or FPGA has always been a challenge.

This folder contains the matrix multiplication code on FPGA optimised for ZC702 board.
